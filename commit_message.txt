fix: Ensure correct file movement in Google Drive

This commit fixes an issue where Google Drive files were not being moved correctly to the newly created project folder.
The `moveFileToFolder` function in `services/googleWorkspaceService.ts` has been updated to:
- First fetch the current parents of the file.
- Then remove all current parents when adding the new parent, ensuring the file is correctly moved regardless of its initial location.
